"""Sub-agents package.

This directory is for organizing sub-agents when building multi-agent systems.
Each sub-agent should have its own subdirectory following the ADK agent structure:

Example structure:
    sub_agents/
    ├── __init__.py (this file)
    └── specialist_agent/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── agent.py

Then import and use in the main agent's tools list.
